discos in v2 and v3
    - we did not have to use super or super()
    - used scanner to recieve user input for Protagonist role

qccs in v2 and v3
    - what would be a good way to make sure that all of our new classes are working properly?

discos in v1:
    - extending the Monster and Protagonist classes with the Character class doesn't change or break the functionality of YoRPG.java
    - maybe this is because methods in the subclasses override the methods of the same name in the superclass
